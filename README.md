## Software projects

Most of my programming is related to my [research](https://jan.hermann.name/publications/) in computational materials science. I believe that strong computational science benefits from strong software engineering, and that all scientific academic software should be open source.

I am involved in the following software projects.

### Creator

- [PyBerny](https://github.com/jhrmnn/pyberny)—Python package for optimizing molecular geometries, supported by [PySCF](https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf), [ASE](https://gitlab.com/ase/ase), and [QCEngine](https://github.com/MolSSI/QCEngine)
- [Libmbd](https://github.com/jhrmnn/libmbd)—Fortran/Python library implementing the many-body dispersion method, embedded in [FHI-aims](https://aimsclub.fhi-berlin.mpg.de) and [DFTB+](https://github.com/dftbplus/dftbplus)
- [DeepQMC](https://github.com/deepqmc/deepqmc)—Pytorch implementation of quantum Monte Carlo with deep neural network ansatzes

### Contributor

- [FHI-aims](https://aimsclub.fhi-berlin.mpg.de)—massively parallel electronic structure code package with DFT at its core

### Beta projects

These are experimental packages that, although fully functional, I don’t yet consider finished.

- [KnitJ](https://github.com/jhrmnn/knitj)—alternative front-end to Jupyter kernels aiming at editor freedom and easy versioning
- [Mona](https://github.com/jhrmnn/mona)—framework for reproducible and distributed, potentially long-running calculations
